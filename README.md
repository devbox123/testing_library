OXID eShop Testing Library
==========================

The OXID eShop testing library can be used to test OXID eShop with existing or new Unit, Integration, Mink or QUnit tests. 
Furthermore, it can also be very helpful to developers who create a module for the OXID eShop.

This library is meant to help developers check their shop/module code with ease. It contains all the required tools and dependencies to execute unit tests, selenium tests, metrics.

## Requirements

* Latest eShop development version (use b-1.0 branch for earlier versions)
* Latest Composer version
* PHP cURL extension
* Not compatible with Windows (use VM instead)

This library can be used to test modules with earlier shop versions, but it will not be possible to run shop tests.

## Installation

Testing library setup uses composer to get required packages, so make sure to have composer installed and accessible. 
You can find composer installation guide [here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

### Selecting where to install testing library

Testing library can be installed directly within shop or to any other directory. 
However, installation varies slightly depending on selected location. We advise to install it using shop directory. 

#### Option 1: Selecting shop directory for installation (preferred way)

To install testing library within shop directory, update/create `composer.json` with following values:
```json
{
    "name": "oxid-esales/eshop",
    "description": "OXID eShop",
    "type": "project",
    "keywords": ["oxid", "modules", "eShop"],
    "homepage": "https://www.oxid-esales.com/en/home.html",
    "license": [
        "GPL-3.0",
        "proprietary"
    ],
    "repositories": {
        "oxid-esales/testing-library": {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/OXID-eSales/testing_library.git"
        },
        "alexandresalome/php-selenium": {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/OXID-eSales/PHP-Selenium.git"
        }
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "oxid-esales/testing-library": "^1.0.0-alpha1",
        "incenteev/composer-parameter-handler": "~2.0"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "prefer-stable": true,
    "scripts": {
        "post-install-cmd": [
            "Incenteev\\ParameterHandler\\ScriptHandler::buildParameters"
        ],
        "post-update-cmd": [
            "Incenteev\\ParameterHandler\\ScriptHandler::buildParameters"
        ]
    },
    "extra": {
        "incenteev-parameters": {
            "file": "test_config.yml",
            "dist-file": "vendor/oxid-esales/testing-library/test_config.yml.dist",
            "parameter-key": "mandatory_parameters",
            "env-map": {
                "shop_path": "SHOP_PATH",
                "shop_tests_path": "SHOP_TESTS_PATH",
                "modules_path": "MODULES_PATH"
            }
        }
    }
}

```
Installing this way, binaries will be accessible from `shop_source_path/vendor/bin`.
Latest development shop version already includes composer.json file in its source, so no changes need to be made.

#### Option 2: Selecting any directory for installation (alternative way)

To install testing library to any directory, you need to checkout testing library from Github into desired directory (`git clone https://github.com/OXID-eSales/testing_library`). 
Installing this way, binaries will be accessible from `testing_library/bin`.

### Installing testing library

After you selected where you want to install the testing library, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory that you picked for installation.
1. Use composer to setup testing library components (`composer install`). Ensure you do this from within the directory where `composer.json` is located. 
During setup you will be asked several questions regarding testing library configuration. 
These options will be explained in more detail here: [Parameter explanation](README.md#configuration)

## Running tests

First and foremost - make sure you have a working shop, meaning:

1. Shop is installed/configured (`config.inc.php` is filled in with database connection details and so)
1. Shop can be accessed through url (used for shop installation).

Several test runners are available for use once testing library is prepared. These are available in `bin` or `vendor/bin` directory:  
`runtests` - run shop/module unit and integration tests.  
`runtests-selenium` - run shop/module selenium tests.  
`runtests-coverage` - run shop/module tests with code coverage.  
`runmetrics` - execute code metrics test for shop/module.  

Additionally you can pass parameters to these scripts. `runmetrics` uses `pdepend`, and all `runtests` uses `phpunit`.
You can add `phpunit` parameters to `runtests`, `runtests-selenium`, `runtests-coverage`.
You can add `pdepend` parameters to `runmetrics`. To see which additional options can be passed to test runner, add `--help` option to the command (i.e. `./runtests --help`, `./runmetrics --help`). This will show available options for desired tool.

Some usage examples:

1. Running only a single file tests - `bin/runtests path/to/test/fileTest.php`
1. Running only specific pattern matching tests from specified file - `bin/runtests --filter match_pattern path/to/test/fileTest.php`
1. Running one or multiple test suites - `TEST_DIRS=unit,integration bin/runtests`

One thing to note when adding parameters to these tools - always provide file/folder at the end as it will no longer be picked automatically. 
Use AllTestsUnit or AllTestsSelenium respectively to run all tests.

### Run with PHPStorm

You need to setup path to bootstrap in order to run tests with PHPStorm.  

1. Open PHPStorm.  
2. Open Run/Debug configurations window.  
3. Press on configuration icon (wrench) right after the "Use alternative configuration file" input.  
4. New PHPUnit window pops up. Check "Default bootstrap file" checkbox and choose path to bootstrap.  
Path to bootstrap: {source}/vendor/oxid-esales/testing-library/bootstrap.php  

## Configuration

Configuration file is named `test_config.yml` and is placed in the root directory of this library or shop (when installing with shop composer.json).
During setup you will be asked several questions regarding testing library and shop/module installation.
After setup `test_config.yml` will be created, and later can be edited if some configuration values need to be changed.

All of the parameters can be set with environmental variables. Environmental parameter names are the same as in
the configuration file, but should be all uppercase: *shop_path* => *SHOP_PATH*, *browser_name* => *BROWSER_NAME*, etc.
 
### Configuration parameters
#### Mandatory parameters
These parameters are required for testing library to work properly.

| Parameter name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|**partial_module_paths** | When testing not activated module, specify module path in shop. Module path in shop, e.g. if module is in `shop/modules/oe/mymodule` directory, value here should be `oe/mymodule`.

### Changing PHPUnit parameters

To change PHPUnit parameters, add phpunit.xml file inside tests directory and it will be used.

### Execution before test run with additional.inc.php

Testing library gives possibility to make some actions before test run. So if there is a need to to do that, add additional.inc.php file into tests directory and it will be executed.
